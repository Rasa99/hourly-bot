A trade needs **all four** of: price breaking its 3-day range, the trend filter agreeing, enough momentum (ADX over 20), and above-average volume. A coin at 0.00% that still has not traded is being held back by one of the other three — the table says which.

### How it works

Watches 47 coins every hour. Goes long when one breaks above its 3-day high, short when one breaks below its 3-day low — but only if the trend, momentum and volume all agree.

Every trade gets a stop-loss. Winners are left to run on a trailing stop rather than closed at a fixed target. It risks 1% of the account per trade and never holds more than 5 positions on the same side, so one bad day cannot end it.

**It loses more trades than it wins** — about 2-3 winners in 10, by design, with the winners much larger. Backtested on 2024-2026 it lost money. This is running on live prices with fake money to see what it actually does.
