| Coin | Would be | Needs | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| NEAR | LONG | 0.48% | needs 0.5% move |
| GRT | LONG | 1.33% | needs 1.3% move |
| MANA | LONG | 1.76% | needs 1.8% move; trend too weak (ADX 13/20) |
| BCH | LONG | 2.06% | needs 2.1% move |
| ATOM | LONG | 2.08% | needs 2.1% move; trend too weak (ADX 16/20) |
| APE | LONG | 2.18% | needs 2.2% move |
| BTC | LONG | 2.23% | needs 2.2% move |
| ETC | LONG | 2.31% | needs 2.3% move; volume below average |
| SOL | LONG | 2.64% | needs 2.6% move; trend too weak (ADX 20/20) |
| BAT | LONG | 2.64% | needs 2.6% move; volume below average |

A trade needs **all four** of: price breaking its 3-day range, the trend filter agreeing, enough momentum (ADX over 20), and above-average volume. A coin at 0.00% that still has not traded is being held back by one of the other three — the table says which.

### How it works

Watches 47 coins every hour. Goes long when one breaks above its 3-day high, short when one breaks below its 3-day low — but only if the trend, momentum and volume all agree.

Every trade gets a stop-loss. Winners are left to run on a trailing stop rather than closed at a fixed target. It risks 1% of the account per trade and never holds more than 5 positions on the same side, so one bad day cannot end it.

**It loses more trades than it wins** — about 2-3 winners in 10, by design, with the winners much larger. Backtested on 2024-2026 it lost money. This is running on live prices with fake money to see what it actually does.
